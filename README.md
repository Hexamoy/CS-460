# Important

This repository houses all of the source code for all of my coding during Western Oregon University's Software Engineering I course. If you would like to see the code for the Capstone Project that my team and I worked on, then you need to visit [this](https://bitbucket.org/Hexamoy/toastercode/src/master/) repository on Bitbucket.
