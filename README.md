# Repository Breakdown

This repository is split into two parts. The CS_460 subfolder houses all of the source code I made while taking Western Oregon University's Software Engineering I course. The Powerlevel subfolder contains all of the source code for the project that my team and I worked on for our Senior Capstone project. This source code was merged in from another repository. If you wish to view the original repository, follow [this](https://bitbucket.org/Hexamoy/toastercode/src/master/) link.
