## Homework 2

Once again, I have never used javaScript or jQuery before but I found the process fun and fairly straight forward. For this assignment, I had to make another webpage and then use javascript and jquery to modify it in some way. Therefore, I decided to do a letter counter that would take an input string from the user and then return a jquery generated table with the total counts of each letter used. I had a lot of fun doing it and it turned out pretty well. I also had to use a seperate branch in git to do this "feature" and then merge it back into the main branch when we were finished. That was cool because I got some experience with branching and actual work flow control.
