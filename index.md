## About Me

I am a Senior at Western Oregon University studying Computer Science. I will be graduating in June 2019 and am looking forward to a long and fulfilling career as a software engineer. I enjoy camping, hiking, and fishing. I like to play videogames as well as watch movies and I really enjoy having LAN parties with friends. Someday I would like to do some traveling. I would love to travel from the west coast to the east coast and do some traveling over seas.

Here is the link to my github repository which houses all of the source code that I used for all of these projects.
