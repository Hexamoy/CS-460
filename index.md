## About Me

I am a recent Western Oregon University Computer Science graduate who is looking to begin a long and fulfilling career as a Software Engineer/Programmer. I enjoy camping, hiking, fishing, am an Eagle Scout, and have a true passion for the outdoors. I am also an avid gamer, movie watcher, and book reader.

Someday I hope to do some travelling. I would love to drive down the west coast on 101 from Cannon Beach all the way to Southern California. I'd also like to do a long trip visiting every connected U.S. state. After that, I want to do at least one trip over seas visiting Countries, Continents, and Nations around the world. I'd love to hear bagpipes in Scotland, see a football game in England, ride a camel in Asia, see China and Japan, travel to India, Egypt, all around Africa, Brazil, Venezuela, and all over.

## Purpose

This is a short Portfolio detailing the projects that I did for the first class in the senior capstone sequence at Western Oregon University. I have also included links to the source code for [Powerlevel](#Powerlevel-Links), which is the capstone project that my team and I made.

### Code Repository

Here is the link to my GitHub repository, which houses all of the source code for my projects.

#### Powerlevel Links

[Here](https://github.com/NicholasLeonard/NicholasLeonard.github.io/tree/master/Powerlevel) is the link to the Powerlevel source code that I moved into this repository.

If you want to view the original repository, please follow [this](https://bitbucket.org/Hexamoy/toastercode/src/master/) link.

There are two repositories because we switched over to bitbucket for the last two classes in the senior capstone sequence and I wanted to move the relevant project files over to my own GitHub repository.
