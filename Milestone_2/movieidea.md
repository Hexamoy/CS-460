###CS Team Toaster Files
##Project Proposal: Movie/Media Synopsis / Tagger


####What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps? (Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?)
 
    The idea of this particular project to create a MVC webapp utilizing an API of either rotten tomatoes, IMBD, or another popular database/review site for movies that allows users to review movies in short text blocks and track the movies that they have seen or are going to see. Additionally, the site would allow the user to search for a movie based on a series of tags for a file that would allow them find more films to watch. To expand upon this, the site would also allow short summaries or film synopsis. The emphasis of the site would be it’s restricted format, keeping all summaries, reviews, and tags short and simple.
    
    The reason this is not already being done is because movie reviews sites are often bloated with extra information and trivia the user often does not need. This site would be simple, compact, and easy to navigate, with an emphasis on user profiles and watchlists.
 
####Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?
 
    The reason the idea is worth doing is because it would provide a network for users to find and track media they want to see with a reduced format for reviews and summaries, allowing users to quickly build a large collect of media either to watch or to talk about. It’s exciting because it can allow others who are not well immersed in a piece of media or series to quickly get the information they care about to try and jump into it, as well as finding things they have never seen to watch and see. It simultaneous acts as a checklist of things to see and seen, as well as a search-site for new things to watch.
 
 
####What are a few major features?
 
    Some of the major features to implement would be:
    User profiles
    API Film Database Backend
    Review Service
    Watchlist Service
    Searching and Tagging system
    Administration Service
 
 
####What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class. i.e. you already have the Microsoft stack, server, database so what else would you need? 
####Additional API’s, frameworks or platforms you’ll need to use.

    The APIs we would use would be either the Rotten Tomatoes review database API or the IMBd movie database API. Either one or both of these would provide a foundation for creating the main pages where reviews, synopsis, and other stats would be held about the films. Additional, review scores from those sites would be references and an additional piece of information for the user.
 
 
####What algorithmic content is there in this project? i.e. what algorithm(s) will you have to develop or implement in order to do something central to your project idea? (Remember, this isn’t just a software engineering course, it is your CS degree capstone course!)
 
    The algorithmic content of this project is the searching and tagging system. Not only assigning tags or pulling tags from the API to form a basis our sites tagging, but allowing user tagging and searching the tags with sufficient search time and allowing users to sort and restrict searches when finding titles  (ie name search, tag restricted, etc.). This would pose a significant challenge is finding not only the right search algorithm as a basis, but altering the system to serve of tagged needs and developing it to work with our existing infrastructure. 
 
 
####Rate the topic with a difficulty rating of 1-10. One being supremely easy to implement (not necessarily short though). Ten would require the best CS students using lots of what they learned in their CS degree, plus additional independent learning, to complete successfully.

    I would rate this project as an 8, challenging to approach and design from our current skill level, but not the absolute hardest it could be to implement. My main worries being the search engine and handling the size of the database given the API.
