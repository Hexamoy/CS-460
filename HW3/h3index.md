## Homework 3

For this assignment, I had to translate a simple Java application into C#. This process turned out to be easier then I had expected. I have very little experience with Java and no experience with C#. However, it was straight forward enough for me to understand and it was very similar to Java. Once more, it was a new and fun experience for me to work with and experiment with C# so that I could develop my understanding of it.

### Step 1. Setting up my IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

This assignment presented the first oppertunity for me to use an IDE for the class. The IDE that I used was Visual Studio 2017 Community addition. I also went through and installed several extensions that allow Visual Studio 2017 to work with C# and the .NET Framework.

### Step 2. Run the Java Program

Before I could start translating the Java code, I had to run the program and see what it actually does. So, using a Windows Command Prompt, I navigated to the folder containing the Java files and ran the program with an input of 12.

I then tried running it without giving it an argument to test the program and see what would happen. It returned a string to the console with an example of how to properly run the program.

To further test the program, I ran it with a string instead of a number and I tried running it with a negative number. The program printed a string to the console saying that it did not recognize the input number, but it seemed to have no response for the negative number except to crash the program.

### Step 3. Translating the program into C#.

Before doing this homework assignment, I had worked with very little Java and I had never touched C#. However, I was able to effectively work out the translation from Java to C# and I actually really like C#. I like its simplicity and format as well as the strength of its type safety. 

I started with the Node class. Because C# contains a lot of similarities to Java, the only real difference between the Java file and the C# file were the nameing conventions, such as capitalization of public variables and methods, the format of the XML comments, and the use of a namespace in C#. I actually started by just translating the code and then came back through later and added the XML comments for the C# code.

```java
/** Singly linked node class. (Java)*/

public class Node<T>
{
	public T data;
	public Node<T> next;
	
	public Node( T data, Node<T> next )
	{
		this.data = data;
		this.next = next;
	}
}
```
```csharp
namespace Translation
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Node class for a singly linked list.
    /// </summary>
    /// <typeparam name="T"></typeparam>
    public class Node<T>
    {
    
        public T Data;
        public Node<T> Next;
        /// <summary>
        /// Constructor for assigning data value and pointer for linked list.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="Data"></param>
        /// <param name="Next"></param>
        public Node( T Data, Node<T> Next )
        {
            this.Data = Data;
            this.Next = Next;
        }
    }
}
```

After I finished the Node file, I moved to the QueueInterface Java file. Once again, there were a lot of similarities between the Java code and the C# code. The only real difference was that the initialized `pop()` function in the Java code had a `throws QueueUnderFlowException`, which cannot be done in the C# code. The exception can still be thrown, that particular code just cannot be in the initialzation of the function in C#. The other big difference was the naming convention. In C#, interfaces declerations begin with an I, so I changed the name of the interface to IQueueInterface and I capitalized the methods to keep inline with C# naming conventions. The other difference was the variable type for a boolean value is bool in C# rather than boolean in Java.
```java
/**
 * A FIFO queue interface.  This ADT is suitable for a singly
 * linked queue. (Java)
 */
public interface QueueInterface<T>
{
    /**
     * Add an element to the rear of the queue
     * 
     * @return the element that was enqueued
     */
    T push(T element);

    /**
     * Remove and return the front element.
     * 
     * @throws Thrown if the queue is empty
     */
    T pop() throws QueueUnderflowException;

    /**
     * Test if the queue is empty
     * 
     * @return true if the queue is empty; otherwise false
     */
    boolean isEmpty();
}
```

```csharp
namespace Translation
{/// <summary>
/// Interface for different queue types.
/// </summary>
/// <typeparam name="T"></typeparam>
    public interface IQueueInterface<T>
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Add an element to the rear of the queue and return the element that was enqueued.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="element"></param>
        /// <returns></returns>
        T Push(T element);

           /// <summary>
           /// Remove and return the front element and throws a QueueUnderFlowException if the queue is empty.
           /// </summary>
           /// <returns></returns>
        T Pop();

        /// <summary>
        /// Test if the queue is empty. Return true if the queue is empty; false otherwise.
        /// </summary>
        /// <returns></returns>
        bool IsEmpty();
    }
}
```

Next up was the QueueUnderFlowException java file. For this file, I had to use class inheritance. User defined exceptions have to inherit properties from the general exceptions class in C#. So I just used the inheritance character `:` to declare the classes in this file. Java also uses `super()` while C# uses `base`. So I used inheritance for that as well.

```java
/**
 * A custom unchecked exception to represent situations where 
 * an illegal operation was performed on an empty queue.
 */
public class QueueUnderflowException extends RuntimeException
{
  public QueueUnderflowException()
  {
    super();
  }

  public QueueUnderflowException(String message)
  {
    super(message);
  }
}
```

```csharp
namespace Translation
{    /// <summary>
    /// A custom exception to represent situations where an illegal operation was performed on an empty queue.
    /// </summary>
    public class QueueUnderFlowException : Exception
    {//user made exception with no message.
        public QueueUnderFlowException() : base()
        {
        }

        //user made exception that displays a message.
        public QueueUnderFlowException(string message) : base(message)
        {
        }
    }
}
```
