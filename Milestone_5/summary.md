# Sprint Retrospective Summary

## Prime Directive of Retrospectives

Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skill and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.

## Safety Check

5 across the board.

## What We Learned

We learned that we need to effectively manage time at the beginning of inception and sprints to get a solid foundation for our architecture and design. We also learned the importance of scheduling time for testing and making sure that we perform thorough tests. We learned how to work as a team and how to fully utilize the resources at our disposal. We also learned the importance of communication and that we need to communicate more through discord so that we can be up to date with everything that each developer is doing. We also learned the importance of gaging how much work we can do and is feasible for our time constraints and current team dynamic. We also learned the importance of writing good user stories with accurate descriptions so we can understand what it is we are actually trying to build.

## What Still is not Going Right

We need to properly set up Dev Ops so that the burn-down chart actually works and displays in our sprints. We also had a problem with the gitignore not working but that has since been resolved.

## What can the Team do Better in the Next Sprint

We can have Dev Ops set up properly and remember to actually track our progress on the site. 

## Action Plan

* Fully set up sprints on Dev Ops before hand

* Update task boards daily

* Update team members over the weekend as to our progress

## Items out side of the Meeting

Nothing to bring up.
