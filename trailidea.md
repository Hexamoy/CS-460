Team Project Ideas

Develop each of your ideas a little more. Do some background research and look for existing solutions. Evaluate your topics thoroughly and then choose TWO to continue with (or your advisor will have discarded one or more already). Write up a short explanation of each topic, that describes it more than you did for Milestone 1. Additionally, answer these questions for each topic:

Trail Finder:
The Trail Finder Project starts with a basic function. The user can enter their coordinates or desired city location, and the website will then generate a list of nearby trails for the user to choose from. Once this list is made, the user is greeted with a quick preview of each trail, this includes the trail name, city location, distance from the user specified coordinates, a photo of the trail, and reviews/ratings of the trail. The user is also able to sort the generated list by trail distance or by the rating the trail has received, within a certain distance (so that there aren't trails 100+ miles away displayed on the nearby trail results). Once a trail from the list is selected, more details on the specified trail will be shown, such as an ability to read trail reviews, more photos to look through, and cool things to check out nearby the trailhead, such as a popular restaurant within a mile of it.

What is new/original about this idea? What are related websites/apps? (Be able to answer the question: isn’t somebody already doing this?)
A similar website found to this project idea is https://www.trailfinder.info/, it contains many of features we hope to implement in our own site, but it also misses on some things. That being, it only contains trails from a few states on the east coast, where our website will aim to include all of the U.S. in trail finding. This site also has no feature included for things to do nearby the trail, and the design itself looks slightly outdated. Sites such as this one are often incomplete, or have more to be desired, which is why our trail site aims to be more of a one-stop shop for anyone's trail seeking search. That said, sites like these also help give us ideas of things we can implement ourselves. 

Why is this idea worth doing? Why is it useful and not boring?
This project is worth doing simply because there is no perfect trail-searching site. Not that ours would be perfect either, but the aim to make something that is simple yet powerful and thus useful to many trail-seekers, giving the project potential to become something great.

What are a few major features?
-Building a list of trails based on your location determined by: Distance or Ratings
-Filtering Options such as: Bike Trail, Walking Trail, Fees to Enter, Dog Accessible
-View Top Thing(s) to do near trail
-Trail Reviews, Difficulty, Length, Photos, Trailhead Location Address, Weather at the location, etc.

What resources will be required for you to complete this project that are not already included in the class. i.e. you already have the Microsoft stack, server, database so what else would you need? Additional API’s, frameworks or platforms you’ll need to use.
https://market.mashape.com/trailapi/trailapi can be utilized for our site, alongside building a database based on preexisting trail information gathered from sources such as Google or Yelp.

What algorithmic content is there in this project? i.e. what algorithm(s) will you have to develop or implement in order to do something central to your project idea? (Remember, this isn’t just a software engineering course, it is your CS degree capstone course!)
The user has many inputs as to what types of trails they want to discover. When selecting to search by Distance or Ratings, an algorithm will grab all trails within a set amount of miles away, and then sort by ratings (if specified), or become organized by each trails distance. It will also filter out trails if the user, for instance, does not want to pay fees to enter, or if they want to find a trail to bike on.

Rate the topic with a difficulty rating of 1-10. One being supremely easy to implement (not necessarily short though). Ten would require the best CS students using lots of what they learned in their CS degree, plus additional independent learning, to complete successfully.
To include all of the desired features, such as finding nearby places to visit, weather reports, scanning with filters enabled, etc. As well as to make an aesthetically pleasing website to look at, this project looks like about a 7. It doesn't come off as impossible, but would require a lot of work in order to make it stand out amongst other trail searching websites.
